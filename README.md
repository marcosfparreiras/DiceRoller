# About this project
This project was developed by following the Lesson 1 (Build your First App) from the course [Developing Android with Kotlin](https://learn.udacity.com/courses/ud9012) at Udacity.

During the lesson, I developed an Android App using Android Studio and Kotlin, that allows me click a button to roll a die, and then I can see an image representing a dice and with a number from 1 to 6 picked randomly. All the art used in the project was provided by the course in Udacity.
